This repository contains a Python script that implements a Random Forest Regressor to predict critical temperatures based on the provided dataset. The script reads the dataset from an Excel file, performs data analysis, splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the Random Forest Regressor, makes predictions, and evaluates the model's performance using various metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in an Excel file named "dataset.xlsx". It contains multiple features along with the critical temperature as the target variable. The script reads this dataset using pandas' `read_excel()` function.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- matplotlib

You can install them using the following command: `pip install `package name
